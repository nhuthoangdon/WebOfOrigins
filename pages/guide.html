    <h4>Reading the Network</h4>
    <p>
        The network visualises connections between consumer products, their direct ingredients/compositions, raw materials, industries, and resulting social/environmental impacts, together with the associated countries in hierarchical order. Use the control panel on the right of the network canvas to find keywords and toggle views (e.g., show/hide countries). Nodes represent entitites; edges show relationships. Hover over nodes and edges to see additional info.

        <b>Nodes are color-coded by hierarchy level</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>• Country:</b> countries associated with the end products (Item nodes) <br>
        <b>• Item:</b> end products (e.g. "Jello"): Blue – Starting points for consumer goods.
        iCountry (item-related countries): Gray (#DFE2E5) – Prominent producers/importers/exporters of items.
        Composition (e.g., ingredients like "Gelatin"): Purple (#C869ED) – Breakdown of item components.
        Source (e.g., "Animal Byproducts"): Blue (#6591FF) – Origins of compositions.
        rawMaterial (e.g., "Chitin"): Brown (#CEA372) – Base materials extracted from sources.
        smCountry (source/material countries): Gray (#DFE2E5) – Key countries for sources/materials.
        Industry (e.g., "Shrimp Farming"): Teal (#60A4C2) – Production processes.
