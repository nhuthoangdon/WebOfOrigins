            <h1>Beyond the surface: From origins to impacts in an interconnected world</h1>
        
            <p>
                Industrial supply chains are vast, complex, and deeply interconnected. A single product often contains many ingredients, some of which may come from questionable or unexpected origins. For example, coffee can be linked to deforestation in the Amazon; vitamin A supplements may contain fish oil from overfished species; photographic film has relied on gelatin derived from animal hides and bones; and even life-saving blood thinners may depend on compounds sourced from pigs. <br>
                <br>
                Whether you are fighting deforestation, ensuring your daily essentials are sourced from sustainable ingredients, or simply curious about what is inside your daily food, understanding product pathways is a good start towards consumer awareness and addressing the right issues.
                <br>
                <br>
                The <b>Web of Origins (WOO)</b> Project stems from this very curiosity, an investigation into the origins of common products and their compositions. It began as a quest to discover what things are made of, where they come from, and how seemingly unrelated items are connected. Ultimately, it serves as a reference point for addressing and improving issues tied to supply chains, sustainability, environmental impacts, ethics, and even social justice. <br>

            <h3>Transparency: a new approach to consumerism and activism</h3>
            <p>
                With growing concerns amidst environmental degradation, social injustices, and ethical dilemmas, transparency in supply chains has become increasingly important. The WOO project aims to promote responsible consumerism, activisim, and production by shedding light on the often opague pathways of material-product supply chains.
