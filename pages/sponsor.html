    <h1>Be part of the project's growth</h1>
    <p>
        The Web of Origins is still in its early stages and needs both technical and financial support. If you find value in this work and wish to help along the way, any contribution â€” whether a $1 coffee or a few words of
        encouragement â€” truly means a lot and keeps the project moving forward. Your support would help cover
        essentials like the domain, tools, hosting, and subscriptions, plus the much-needed coffees for late-night research ðŸ˜‰.<br>
        <br>
        Thank you readers and supporters for being part of this journey!
    </p>
