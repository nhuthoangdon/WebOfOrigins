        <h1>The Web of Origins Project</h1>

        <p class="about-text">
            Everything we use, from coffee and drugs to the household items in our homes, is a product of complex industrialisation processes. A lot of them might share the same origins, connect to one another, or result in similar impacts. Web of Origins is an ambitious project dedicated to mapping the network of materials and impacts through an extensive database and dynamic visualisations. It catalogs a vast array of products, including household items, organic goods like food and drugs, and inorganic materials like plastics and minerals, revealing the intricate relationships between industries. The project also aims to highlight how comsumer products directly or indirectly relate to social and environmental impacts, from ethical and well-being issues to ecological sustainability. By making these connections transparent, the Web of Origins empowers people to make informed choices and fosters a deeper understanding of the world’s interconnected industrial systems and supply chains.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.weboforigins.com">weboforigins.com</a> is committed to providing general, unbiased, evidence-backed data, ensuring transparency and accuracy through current and available information. While still in its early stages, the database will continue to grow and expect ongoing expansion and improvment over time. <br>
            <br>
            I'm open to collaboration and partnerships, please feel free to reach out if you have ideas, feedback, or simply want to say hi. If you think Web of Origins is a good idea and want to help it bloom, you can fuel my late-night research with a coffee, or chip in a small donation for things like domain, tool subscriptions, and hosting until it is self-sustaining. I hope to migrate it from Github to a more scalable platform as it grows, so every bit of support counts.
