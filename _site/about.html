        <h1>Beyond the surface: From origins to impacts in an interconnected world</h1>

        <p>
            Today’s consumer goods—from your morning coffee to medications to household items — emerge from vast, interconnected industrial webs. Many of their ingredients and materials overlap across sectors,
            creating shared environmental and social impacts.  <br>
            <br>
            Whether you’re an activist fighting deforestation, a vegan ensuring your daily essentials are free of animal-derived ingredients, or simply curious about what’s inside your vitamin capsules, understanding the root causes matters. <br>
            <br>
            Who would imagine that coffee could be linked to deforestation in the Amazon, that supplements might contain fish oil from overfished species, that photographic film relied on gelatin made from animal hides and bones, or that life-saving blood thinners might depend on compounds derived from pigs?
            <br>
            <br>
            The <b>Web of Origins (WOO)</b> Project stems from this very curiosity, an investigation into the origins of everyday products and their compositions. It began as a quest to discover what things are made of, where they come from, and how seemingly unrelated items are connected. Ultimately, it serves as a reference point for addressing and improving issues tied to supply chains, sustainability, environmental impacts, ethics, and even social justice. <br>
        </p>
        <div class="text-paragraph">
            <h4>Transparency: a new approach to consumerism and activism</h4>
            <p>
                <b>WOO</b>'s ambition is to catalog a wide range of products and their sources, exploring the entangled web of industrialisation and seeks to reveal how products and industries are directly or indirectly linked to social and environmental impacts, from ethical concerns and human well-being to ecological sustainability. By making these connections publicly visible, WOO promotes transparency and empowers people to make informed choices and encourages a deeper understanding of the world’s interconnected industrial systems and supply chains.

                <i>The project is still in its early stages and needs both technical and financial support. If you find value in this work and wish to help along the way, any contribution — whether a $1 coffee or a few words of encouragement — truly means a lot and keeps the project moving forward. Your support would help cover essentials like the domain, tools, hosting, and subscriptions (plus the much-needed coffees for late-night research) until the website becomes self-sustaining.</i><br>
                <br>
                Thank you readers and supporters for being part of this journey!
